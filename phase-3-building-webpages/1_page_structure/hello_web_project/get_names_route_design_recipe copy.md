# get /names Route Design Recipe

_Copy this design recipe template to test-drive a Sinatra route._

## 1. Design the Route Signature

You'll need to include:
  * the HTTP method
  * the path
  * any query parameters (passed in the URL)
  * or body parameters (passed in the request body)

Expected response (200 OK)
Method: GET
Path: /names
Query paramenters:
  names (string)
Return string Julia, Mary, Karim

## 2. Design the Response

The route might return different responses, depending on the result.

For example, a route for a specific blog post (by its ID) might return `200 OK` if the post exists, but `404 Not Found` if the post is not found in the database.

Your response might return plain text, JSON, or HTML code. 

_Replace the below with your own design. Think of all the different possible responses your route will return._

when query param `names` is `Julia, Mary, Karim`
```html
Julia, Mary, Karim
```




## 3. Write Examples

_Replace these with your own design._

```
# Request:

GET /names?names=Julia, Mary, Karim

# Expected response:

Julia, Mary, Karim
```

```
# Request:

GET /names?names=Bruce, Clark, Diana

# Expected response:

Bruce, Clark, Diana
```

## 4. Encode as Tests Examples

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
# file: spec/integration/application_spec.rb

require "spec_helper"

describe Application do
  include Rack::Test::Methods

  let(:app) { Application.new }

  context "GET /names" do
    it "returns a string of names" do
      response = get("/names?names=Julia, Mary, Karim")

      # Assert the response status code and body.
      expect(response.status).to eq(200)
      expect(response.body).to eq("Julia, Mary, Karim")
    end

    it "returns another string of names" do
      response = get("/names?names=Bruce, Clark, Diana")

      # Assert the response status code and body.
      expect(response.status).to eq(200)
      expect(response.body).to eq("Bruce, Clark, Diana")
    end
  end
end
```

## 5. Implement the Route

Write the route and web server code to implement the route behaviour.
